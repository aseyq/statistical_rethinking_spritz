# Statistical Rethinking Spritz

Hi there and thanks for your interest. In this study group, we will work on famous "Statistical Rethinking" book by Richard McElreath. It is a course on Bayesian Statistics (but with many insights regardless to the approach). In addition to the book itself, there is also a set of videos.

## What we will do?
**First of all, we'll keep each other accountable**. We all have busy schedules and it is easy to sacrifice from self-study hours when something more urgent comes up. So the first thing is to set a fixed schedule to study each chapter. And with a group of friends, it is much easier and fun to follow it.

Beside that, I think **we can watch lecture videos together**. Most of them are between 1h and 1h20mins. We can watch these over zoom and then **discuss and solve some of the questions together** at the end of each chapter. I think it is useful if we can ask quick questions to each other in case something is unclear. As the name of the group suggests, I imagined that we'd gather around aperitivo time, so we can eat and drink at the same time.

During the week, if you watch the videos by yourself, you can also join the discussion session only. Or skip it all together, given that you've worked on your own.

## How long will it take?
It depends on how often we'd like to meet. I imagined a prefence towards a meeting every two weeks as once a week would probably be too demanding.  

The video sessions would take around 1h 30minutes each. We can restrict following discussion would take another 30minutes and have a two hours meeting scheduled every two weeks. In my opinion even just watching the videos would be sufficient. But during these two weeks, if you'd like to study the relevant chapter, i guess it might take another hour for you, depending on how deep you get involved with the material.



## Audience
The book defines the target audience as:

> The principle audience is researchers in the natural and social sciences, whether new PhD students or seasoned professionals, who have had a basic course on regression but nevertheless remain uneasy about statistial modelling.

About the group, in principal you can refer to other people, like friends from other disciplines, as long as they respect the rules.
